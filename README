DESCRIPTION

Date::Business provides the functionality to perform simple
date manipulations quickly. Support for calendar date and
business date math is provided.
 
Business dates are weekdays only. Adding 1 to a weekend
returns Monday, subtracting 1 returns Friday. User defined
Holidays are supported. 

Date::Business works very well for iterating over dates,
and determining start and end dates of arbitray n business day
periods (e.g. consider how to perform a computation for
a series of business days starting from an arbitrary day).
 
 $end   = new Date::Business(); # today
 $start = new Date::Business($end, -10); # 10 business days ago

 while (!$start->gt($end)) {
   compute_something($start);
   $start->nextb();
 }
